Getting rid of MySQL SSL Warning Message
JDBC and MySQL: Getting rid of the dreaded message

WARN: Establishing SSL connection without server’s identity verification is not recommended

---

When connecting to a MySQL database, you may encounter this scary warning message.

WARN: Establishing SSL connection without server’s identity verification is not recommended

Your app will continue to work fine … it is just the MySQL database yelling at you.

Solution

To get rid of the warning message, append ?useSSL=false to the end of your database connection string.

For example,

Replace – jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/demo

With – jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/demo?useSSL=false

Note that I appended ?useSSL=false to the end.

That will get rid of the pesky message … whew!
