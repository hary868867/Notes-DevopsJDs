Currently I am working on Azure Devops services.

As a Devops Engineer I will create the infrastructure for developers and testers and maintain it as well.

My Main role is automating the CICD pipeline.

We are using the Azure Repos for source code maintenance.

We are using the Build Pipeline for building the code with different tasks based on application platforms like java and dotnet.

We are using Sonarqube as a code quality analysis tool. And we are using custom metrics for code quality.

Creating the Release pipelines and enabling the CICD pipelines and deploying the artifacts in different environments like DEV, SIT, QA with proper approval setup.

Once the build is successful the Release pipeline gets triggered automatically and deployment will happen in the Lower environment (DEV).

Once the deployment is validated by developers in Lower environments, they will promote the deployments into next environments with proper approvals.

And we have implemented notification schema for build and release pipelines to email notification on Build and Deployment Status.

And performing the admin related tasks as well.

Apart from this I have worked on Git, Jenkins, Maven, MS Build, Udeploy, Nexus, Jfroj, Ansible, and AWS beanstalk service in previous projects.

 

Coming to workflow, attending the daily standups, discussing what I have done, what I am doing and discussing on Blockers.

And closely work with Development teams for getting the inputs.

Sending the status mails to team and client. Attending the CRâ€™s
